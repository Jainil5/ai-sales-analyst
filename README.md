## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the AI Sales Analyst up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Obtain the project source code from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jainil5/ai-sales-analyst.git](https://github.com/jainil5/ai-sales-analyst.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:** Change your current directory to the backend folder.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:** It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

    # Install the required Python packages from the requirements file
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your `backend` directory listing dependencies like Flask, PyTorch, pandas, etc.)*

4.  **Run the Backend Server:** Start the Flask development server.
    ```bash
    python flask_app.py
    ```
    *(Ensure your `flask_app.py` file contains the necessary Flask application setup.)*

5.  **Open the Frontend:** Navigate to the `frontend` directory in your project. Locate the main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in your web browser.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    # Now open the relevant HTML file (e.g., index.html) in your browser.
    # You can usually do this by simply double-clicking the file.
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **API Endpoints:** The frontend likely interacts with the backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/sales-data`, `/api/chatbot`). Ensure that the backend server is running correctly on the specified host and port (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default for Flask development).
* **Data Source:** The backend application must be configured to access your sales data. Review the backend code (`flask_app.py` or related files) to understand how it fetches and processes the data.
* **Chatbot Model:** The PyTorch-powered chatbot requires a trained model. Ensure that the necessary model files and loading mechanisms are correctly implemented in the backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Once you have the application running, you can:

* **Explore the Dashboard:** Navigate through the different sections of the sales metrics dashboard to visualize your key performance indicators.
* **Interact with the Chatbot:** Type your sales-related questions into the chatbot interface and see the intelligent responses.
* **(Optional) Dive into the Code:** If you are a developer, explore the backend and frontend code to understand the architecture and potentially contribute to the project.
